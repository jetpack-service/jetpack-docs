## **What are the benefits of the token beyond rewards?**

JetPack tokens will be used in the services we are developing. These services will reward users with JetPack tokens based on their activities and allow access to premium features at discounted prices by combining JetPack tokens and cash. Additionally, the more tokens a user spends, the easier it becomes to level up in the service. As the level increases, the allocated amount of tokens also grows, enabling app services to provide more JetPack tokens to users. The token distribution for each level will be adjustable via the Ancient Degen Bunnies in the final governance phase.

## **Why is it beneficial to hold or use tokens instead of selling them immediately?**

We plan to create a dedicated JetPack token exchange, but listing on major exchanges like Binance is unlikely. Tokens can be sold through the exchange we are preparing, where I will purchase the majority to ensure liquidity. Tokens will not be burned, and the purchase funds will come from 20% of the service's advertising revenue, which will be transparently disclosed. Additionally, to list on major exchanges like Binance, liquidity must be secured, and in the initial phase, I will likely be the sole purchaser of tokens. Until significant investors who believe in JetPack tokens emerge, I will take the lead in maintaining liquidity. Considering the potential value appreciation of the token, holding it could be advantageous.

Staking is not under consideration, but **JetPack tokens will be distributed as rewards for NFT staking**. **OG Degen Bunnies NFTs** will receive the highest rewards and support will also be extended to NFTs from rug pull projects to promote community expansion.

## **Can the tokens be used in certain services? For example, can I pay for TapTools Pro with JetPack?**

Initially, the focus will be on app services that can utilize JetPack tokens. Usage in other services is not yet under consideration, but if requests are made from platforms like TapTools Pro, Binance, or Upbit, integration could be reviewed. However, if we successfully prove our value, natural integration with the Cardano ecosystem is expected. To achieve this, support from various communities and users will be crucial.

## **What is the difference between Jet and Pack?**

1 Jet = 1,000,000 Pack. This is similar to the concept of 1 ADA = 1,000,000 Lovelace. They are not two separate tokens but rather different units of a single token.
