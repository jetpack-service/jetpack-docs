# JetPack Service Roadmap

The vision of JetPack Service is to realize “**Coexistence between Users and Services**.”

**Phase 1** outlines the key features and app completion timelines across each stage, from Stage-1 to Stage-5. In this phase, all necessary functionalities for seamless integration between the JetPack system and its services will be developed, with a focus on launching core AI-driven services progressively. Each stage is guided by the mission of **“AI-First Service Initiative”**.

**Phase 2** will commence once JetPack Service has demonstrated sufficient value. This phase will introduce JetPack’s token-based advertising system and integrations with third-party platforms such as metaverse and e-commerce. A detailed schedule will be announced later.
